## Easy use see train.py ##

------------------------------

the log file for JDA in SEED is JDA.log

the acc for JDA in SEED is between 75% and 77%

Since the author's data preprocessing method is not public, I used Huan Wei's data preprocessing method, so the performance is very different from the 88% in the original paper.
use code:

```bash
cd ./JDA
python train.py
```
to run
